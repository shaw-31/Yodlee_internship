Web Scraping using Beautiful soup

There are 7 .py files
1. main.py
2. get_final_val.py
3. tokenize_tables.py
4. get_table_consistency_geometric.py
5. plotting.py (not necessary) [independent]
6. ml_plot.py  [independent]
7. jumble.py   [independent]


Steps :
 
	~ start with main.py. It uses (3),(4) and (2)  [Check the import statements for clarification]
	~ All the values are returned to main.py and the table info is also stored in the csv files using the same script.
	~ jumble.py is the run to shuffle the csv contents (row shuffle) if necessary
	~ ml_plot.py does the classification of data in the stored csv files and then prediction to get accuracy scores.


  NOTE : plotting.py is NOT required but it can be used when we have data in csv and want to plot line graphs.
